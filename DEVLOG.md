- debugging in progress, dashboard is not refreshing as expected
- "track" and "stop tracking" appear to be working correctly

## [2025-07-03]
- started adding a "track group" button, wip
- changed and cleaned up some labels

## [2025-07-02]

- realised "join group" is not correct - anyone can and should be able to contribute to a metric
- checked multi-user flow - added privacy, follow, favourite, validation, to my considerations

## [2025-07-01]

- updated the dashboard to bring all information and action to the front
