- set the reset-password redirect path in the app, rather than in supabase
- this successfully decouples registration confirmation and reset password

- started consolidating styles, in preparation for dark/light modes WIP

## [2025-07-10]
- added logout and a user-check
- Attempted to implement improved password reset by updating Supabase Auth redirect URLs
- Discovered side effect: new user registration began redirecting to password reset instead of login/dashboard.
- Cause: Auth redirect URL misconfigurationâ€”same route used for both registration and password reset, but app does not distinguish between confirmation and recovery tokens.
- Reverted changes to restore registration, but this broke password reset.
- Next steps: Review and refactor Supabase Auth URL configuration and front-end token handling to decouple registration confirmation and password reset flows.
- upgraded Expo to 53.0.0 (was 52.0.46)

## [2025-07-01]
